    "Many people fear the unknown. To try to relieve this fear, people often turn to facts: constants that remain in their life regardless of the circumstances.  The one constant astrophysicists can rely on is the gravitational pull between objects.  This force affects everything, from how we walk on the earth to how the universe is kept together.  But could the one force that we rely on be the very thing that causes our inevitable doom?  What happens when two galaxies are under the gravitational force?  How will that impact our future?"
