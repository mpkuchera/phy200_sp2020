    "In the game of baseball, a ball is thrown and hit in the blink of an eye. Throwing a baseball may look and feel simple, but there are so many factors that come in to play. The speed and angle at which the ball is thrown affects the height and speed of where the ball crosses home plate. Other factors such as air resistance on the ball, spin on the ball, distance from the mound to the plate, position the ball is released, etc, all play a role. I will take you through through the physics behind a baseball pitch and at the end you will be able to input some values within reasonable parameters so you can see how each aspect plays a role in a 2D model of the trajectory of a baseball pitch! Let's have some fun!"

    "I am going to talk about three important forces that play a role in a real life baseball pitch! First, I will go through what the gravitational force is all about. Then, I will focus on the force that opposes the direction of motion which is known as the drag force. Finally, I will introduce a force that isn't talked about much, but is very common in sports such as baseball with a spinning ball. This force is called the magnus force which accounts for the lift on the ball."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most obvious force that acts on everything is the force of gravity. Without this force, any object, including a baseball would defy the laws of physics! The gravitational constant on earth is 9.8m/s which is one of the most common constants known in physics. The weight of the baseball would be the mass * gravitational constant, which as for any object is directed toward the center of the earth. \n",
    "\n",
    "By rule, the weight of a major league baseball is 5 ounces. A baseball is made with a solid core, a string wrapping around the core, and a stitched covering, so the weight is distributed throughout the ball. But we can often think of the weight as collected and acting through a single point called the center of gravity. The center of gravity is the average location of the weight of an object. To first order, the center of gravity for a baseball is located at the exact center of the ball. In flight, the ball rotates about the center of gravity. Newton's laws of motion describe the translation of the center of gravity. The physics describing the rotation, translation, weight and center of gravity of a baseball is the same for any ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gravity only acts in the y-direction which you can test by dropping any object! The object would go straight down, not to the right, left, or up. Newton found this out by sitting under an apple tree...or so I'm told. All I'm saying is if your object doesn't go straight down, alert the authorities because you just won a nobel prize in physics!

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As the ball moves through the air, the air resists the motion of the ball and the resistance force is called drag. Drag is directed along and opposed to the flight direction. In general, there are many factors that affect the magnitude of the drag force including the shape and size of the object, the square of the velocity of the object, and conditions of the air; particularly, the density and viscosity of the air. Determining the magnitude of the drag force is difficult because it depends on the details of how the flow interacts with the surface of the object. For a baseball, this is particularly difficult because the stitches used to hold the ball together are not uniformly or symmetrically distributed around the ball. Depending on the orientation of the ball in flight, the drag changes as the flow is disturbed by the stitches. To determine the magnitude of the drag, aerodynamicists normally use a wind tunnel to measure the drag on a model. For a baseball, the drag can be determined experimentally by throwing the ball and accurately measuring the change in velocity as the ball passes between two points of known distance."

    "\n",
    "The magnus force which is also known as lift is the component of the aerodynamic force that is perpendicular to the flight direction. Airplane wings generate lift to overcome the weight of the airplane and allow the airplane to fly. A rotating cylinder and a spinning ball also generate aerodynamic lift. Like the drag, the magnitude of the lift depends on several factors related to the conditions of the air and the object, and the velocity between the object and the air. For a spinning ball, the speed of rotation affects the magnitude of the aerodynamic force and the direction of the force is perpendicular to the axis of rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The orientation of the axis of rotation can be varied by the pitcher when the ball is thrown. If the axis is vertical, the lift force is horizontal and the ball can be made to curve to one side. If the axis is horizontal, the lift force is vertical and the ball can be made to dive or loft depending on the direction of rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stitches on a baseball introduce some additional complexity in the generation of lift and drag. For any object, the aerodynamic force acts through the center of pressure. The center of pressure is the average location of the aerodynamic forces on an object. For an ideal, smooth ball, symmetry considerations place the the center of pressure at the center of the ball along with the center of gravity. But a baseball in flight is neither smooth nor symmetric because of the stitches. So the center of pressure for a baseball moves slightly about the center of the ball with time, depending on the orientation of the stitches. The time-varying aerodynamic force causes the ball to move erratically. This motion is the source of the \"dancing\" knuckleball that confuses both batters and catchers alike. To account for the complexities when making predictions of the lift, aerodynamicists make an ideal prediction using theory, and then correct the prediction using experimental data. The lift coefficient - CM for the baseball was determined by high speed photography of the flight of a pitched ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of the ball through the air depends on the relative strength and direction of the forces shown above. Where there is less air pressure is the way the ball is spinning and on the other side of the baseball where there is higher air pressure, the ball is spinning in the direction opposite to that of the drag force."
