    "The motion of a pendulum is one that is often used for studying periodic motion, where an ideal pendulum is one that oscillates with a specific period. But the period of a pendulum can be changed by external forces, against the motion (damping effect) or adding to the motion (driving effect). In this essay, we will see the effects of both seprately and together through sevral angular position versus time plots, and futher delve into the motion as it reaches chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This essay will be exploring a Damped Driven Pendulum and the differential equation of the motion, which includes both the damped and driving term. The equation is as follows:\n",
    "<img src=\"Diff_eq.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "where the dots represent the order of the differential and the Greek letter phi represents the angular position, hence phi-dot is the angular velocity and phi-double-dot is the angular acceleration. The greek letter Beta is b/m, where b is the damping constant and m is the mass of the object on the pendulum in kg. Omega-knot is the natural frequency of the pendulum but, omega-knot squared is g/L (g is the gravitational constant and L is the length of the string the mass hangs from), γ is the driving strength (Force/weight of the mass on pendulum), and ω is the drive frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The libraries that were used were Numpy and Pylab, for mathematical notation and plotting. The differentical equation that had been used is the same one mentioned above, however, this program is centered mostly around the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. In order to use this method, the second order differential equation is divided into two first order differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$ \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = \\omega\\ $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "   $$\\frac{d\\omega}{dt} = \\omega_0^2 \\gamma \\cos{\\omega t} - 2 \\beta \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} - \\omega_0^2 \\phi$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The program relies on the fourth order Runge-Kutta method, which is a method of integrating differential equations by using a step method. And, the fourth order Runge-Kutta method is outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "k_1& = &hf(x,t)\\\\\n",
    "k_2& = &hf(x+\\frac{1}{2}k_1),t+\\frac{1}{2}h) \\\\\n",
    "k_3& = &hf(x+\\frac{1}{2}k_2,t+\\frac{1}{2}h) \\\\\n",
    "k_4& = &hf(x+k_3,t+h)\\\\\n",
    "x(t+h)& = & x(t) + \\frac{1}{6}(k_1+2k_2+2k_3+k_4)\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the f(x) function is coded below, and contains the two first order differential equations. r is assigened to an array with two elements, the initial phi angle and starting angular velocity. Addtionally, there is also costants function, which is the only function that will be need to be alterted by the user. Providing different initial contions will yield different types of motion.\n"

In a similar manner, the State Space graph  shows the Angular velocity versus the Angular postion, which is like an orbit–a result we expect as the radius of the shape does not change, indicating the repetition of the same motion and the maintenance of the same period throughout. \n",

The State Space diagram shows that the period is increasing as more times passes, and this is no loger an ideal pendulum. This senario can be thought of as a pendulum we all see in our everyday lives; due to friction the motion of a pendulum eventually comes to a complete halt.

This motion from t = 0 to t = 5.0 shows transient brehaviour, which is the initial behaviour caused by the combination on the damping and driving term. The behaviour dies down due to fact that the driving frequency overcomes the damping motion and the natural frequency of the pendulum and remains with only the driving term. The State Space plot shows the changes in period as the trasient motion dies down, and begins to settle into a new period. If the motion were to continue, the State Space would have a new constant radius.    "

If I were to futher continue, I would approach this with a double pendelum system, where I would be able to more clearly, see the results of initial conditions on the motion of a damped drived pendulum. And to do that, the first step would be to find a differntial equation for the system, but the remaining of the program would look the same. "
